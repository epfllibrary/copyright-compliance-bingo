# Copyright compliance game

## Disclaimer
This game was designed to comply with the Swiss context where the PhD theses are published. You should check if the answers comply with your country's copyright law.

## Aim of the game
*1st round:* fill all the board's squares with the correct answer using the Yes / No Cards.
*2nd round:* according to the answers given during the first round, fill all the board's squares with the Reasons and Alternative cards.

## Number of players
Ideally between 2-4 players. The game can also be played individually.

## Duration
30 minutes, including intial instructions, game play and debriefing with the participants.

## Material
- 1 board
- 2 types of answer cards
	- Yes / No Cards for the first round
	- Reasons (5 types of blue cards) and Alternatives (3 types of yellow cards) for the second round

## Audience
Undergraduate, Master and PhD students

## Game Preparation
(Print and cut all the material, see gamepreparation.md for details)

Hand a board and a set of cards to each group of players.

## Game play
### Board description
The column on the left presents 4 contexts in which images were created
The bottom line presents 4 contexts in which the images may be reused.
The board presents 16 cases to be read from left to right, as follows: "Can I copy-paste and cite my own graph/image already published in a former publication for my PhD candidacy project?"
The aim is to understand for each case if citing the author is sufficient or not to comply with copyright rules.

### Playing
Players need to choose an answer card for each square of the board. Players fill the board together, discussing the answers. They have to be quick.
There are 2 rounds:

- *1st round:* the participants use the **Yes / No** cards to decide if they are allowed to reuse different types of images in 4 given contexts.  
- *2nd round:* this round is played according to the first round's answers:
	- In each square where the participants put a Yes card, they have to choose one of the Reason cards (shades of blue) to explain their choice.
	- In each square where the participants put a No card, they have to choose one of the Alternative cards (shades of yellow) to determine a way to get out of the dead-end.   
When the board is filled, the players shout "Bingo!" and the teacher comes to check the correctness.

It is important to take a few minutes at the end to display the correct combination to the classroom and to make sure the key concepts are well understood:

- an image/graph cannot be reused the same way as a sentence
- the final goal (publishing or not) and the origin of the image/graph determine under which condition it can be reused.
- Creative Commons licenses
- the educational purpose clause


## Variants
### Speed contest
If several groups are playing, speed can be an additional stake.

### Audience
The 4 contexts proposed on the bottom line can be adapted according to the audience.

### Rounds
The 2 rounds can be played in a row. However, a break can be introduced in between to make sure everyone has it right before starting the second round.

### Number of Cards
We make available more copies of each card than what the players really need to fill the board, so that the participants cannot deduce where the leftover cards go. However, with beginners, it could be easier to provide them with the right amount of each type of card.
