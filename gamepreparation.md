## Select the appropriate files
Willing to play the game as it is? Use the .pdf files available in the readytouse-game folder. 2 versions are available: 1 for PhD students and 1 for undergraduate or master students.
Willing to adapt the game? Use the .docx or .odt files available in the adaptable-game folder to modifiy the board and cards as you wish.

## Print the files
The files' format is A3.

## Cut the cards
Choose the bulk version if you want to print plenty of cards because you will play with multiple groups simultaneously.
Choose the Ready to print version if you want to have just one game.

## Laminate the board and cards
To ensure they survive several sessions of excited participants who want to be the fastest!

## Prepare the game set
Use 2 envelopes per game set:
- one for the Yes / No Cards
- one for the Reasons / Alternative cards

It may be useful to have an additional envelope with extra cards in case a few are missing (we never know)
